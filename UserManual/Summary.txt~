Agent-based models (ABMs) often exhibit non-linear and stochastic dynamics leading to complex emergent (macroscopic) behaviour. In these models the same parameter set can lead to multiple outcome states due to different initial conditions. As a consequence, analysis of the emergent behaviour is difficult and mostly limited to averaging simulation observations and parameter sweeps providing limited information about the system. The recent development of equation-free methods enable the application of well established mathematical techniques for analysing non-linear systems to ABMs, such as numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis. Numerical continuation allows efficient path-following of macroscopic dynamics, leading to rich quantitative and qualitative information. Classically these techniques require a mathematical description for macroscopic evolution of the system, however equation-free methods allow this equation to be replace with agent-level (microscopic) simulations. Bifurcation analysis probes the stability of paths in the system and can explain the transient behaviour of a models dynamics, and why the same parameter set can lead to different emergent states.

Equation-free continuation has been used to analyse the emergent behaviour of ABMs. However, previous investigations have required specific implementation as no generic software is available. Additionally, equation-free methods require the tuning of some essential parameters that are specific to each ABM and obtained through trial and error. These knowledge and time barriers have restricted this powerful form of analysis to a few studies only. Here we have developed a generic tool to perform equation-free continuation on any ABM and requires no knowledge of the mathematics or implementation involved. Our tool 'wraps around' an ABM and can be utilised by investigators from any background to analyse their models. Moreover, we have also developed a systematic method for automatic configuration of the equation-free parameters to specific ABMs, again requiring no knowledge base from the user. Our tool enables users of any background to perform this type of analysis on their ABM with minimal input. The tool is demonstrated on several ABMs included here with supplementary codes, figures and manuals. In each case we uncover a systematic description of the emergent behaviour based only on microscopic simulations. These examples illustrate how this tool can be used to extract mathematical understanding for the dynamics of a complex system based on rule sets.
