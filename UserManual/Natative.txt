Systems of complexity are often described using agent-based models (ABMs) in the absence of a mathematical representation for the macroscopic behaviour of the system. These models often contain multiple agents that interact non-linearly in a random manor resulting in complex and stochastic behaviour. Currently there are few analysis tools for ABMs and the macroscopic behaviour often can not be determined from these or simulations alone. Numerical continuation (NC) is a process that can efficiently analyse the dynamics of non-linear and stochastic systems, reviling the macroscopic properties and parameter dependency of a system (see Figure 1). When coupled with so called Equation-free (EF) methods, one can perform NC on ABM models directly enabling detailed analysis of the systems dynamics (see Figure 2). Here we have developed a package for users to perform this type of analysis on their ABMs without knowledge of EF, NC or programming beyond NetLogo, i.e. a black box. This generic user-friendly package (see Figure 3) can be applied to ABMs with several example given in the repository. Our package provides a platform of users with any background to perform investigate the dynamics of their models, uncovering details about equilibria, stability and the transient behaviour of the ABM as well as automated statistical analysis.
